  /** Finds an ancestor of `startHash` at `height` in p-DAG.
    *
    * This is done by recursively looking up a parent of a block at specific height.
    *
    * Every block is stored with a list of its parents at heights that are power of 2.
    * i.e.
    * {{{
    * G <- A <- B <- C <- D <- E <- F <- G <- H
    * 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 (main rank, p-DAG ranks)
    * }}}
    * We're considering block `H`. Its parents' heights (counting from `H`) are:
    * {{{
    * g <- A <- B <- C <- D <- E <- F <- G <- H
    * 8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1
    * -                   -         -    - parents with power of 2 heights
    * 3                   2         1    0 exponents
    * }}}
    *
    * `H` will be stored with a list of parents and their distance from `H`:
    * (H, 1, G)
    * (H, 2, F)
    * (H, 4, D)
    * (H, 8, g)
    *
    * The same is done for all blocks that come before `H`.
    * If we're looking for a parent of `H` at height 1 we calculate a height difference,
    * which is 7, then decompose it into sum of powers of 2 (4, 2, 1) and recursively look
    * for ancestors at these heights. They will be at i-th index in the block's parents array.
    * {{{
    * (H, 4) -> (H, 2^2) -> D
    * (D, 2) -> (D, 2^1) -> B
    * (B, 1) -> (B, 2^0) -> A
    * }}}
    *
    * Note that if we were looking for an ancestor of the block that is at exactly power of 2 distance
    * from the block, we would find it immediately in the DB.
